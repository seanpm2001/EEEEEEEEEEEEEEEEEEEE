<!-- Welcome to EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! !-->

EEEE EEEEEEE EE E EEEE EEEEEEE EEEE EEEEE EEEEE EE EEE EEEEEE E.

<!-- This project is a joke project with heavy usage of the letter E. !-->

EEEEEEE EEEE, EE EEEEE EEE E EEEE.

<!-- Despite this, it still has a goal. !-->

EEE EEEEE EE EEEE EEEEEEE EE EEEEEEEE EE EE E EEEE EEEEEEE, EEE EE EEEE EEEEE EE EE E EEEEE E EEEE EEEEEEEEE (EEEE EE EEE EEEE E EEEEE EEEEE EE EEEE EEEEEEEE EEEE EEEEEEE, EEEEEEEEEE, EE EEE EEEE EE EE EEEEEEEEEE EEEEE, EEE EEEE EEEEE EE EEEEEEEEE)

<!-- The theme of this project is designed to be a joke project, but it also plans to be a basic E meme generator (this is the best I could think of when planning this project, originally, it was only to be Markiplier based, but that would be pointless) !-->

EE EE EEEEE E EEEEE EEEE EE EEEEEEEE.

<!-- It is still a major work in progress. !-->
